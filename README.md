# Snort_Log_Server
A tool for simplifying network administration. Gets log messages from Snort IDS, processes them, classifies them as either THREAT / NOT_THREAT then creates a pop up window incase of a threat.

This simple Snort Log Server also supports SSH server connections i.e you can connect to a gateway via SSH and perform a few operations (Blacklist a Mac address and Deassociate a machine).
